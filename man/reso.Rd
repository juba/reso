\title{Apply the RESO algorithm to a graph}
\usage{
reso(g)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{an igraph graph}
}
\value{
Character vector with each vertex group. Groups are given in the form XX_YY,
where XX is the type of group ("WP" for weak points, "1-AP" for 1-order
articulation points, "CC" for connected components, and "CCsing" for
singleton connected components), and YY the level of the group (the iteration
during which the group has been produced).
}

\examples{
## Random graph
g <- igraph::sample_gnp(26, 0.15)
plot(g)
res <- reso(g)
plot_reso(g, res)
